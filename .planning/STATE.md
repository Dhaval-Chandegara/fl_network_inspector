## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Structured 6 horizontal layers (Foundation -> Persistence -> Interception -> UI -> Triggers -> Testing/Release) to eliminate technical debt and stream crashes.
- [Architecture]: Enforce pre-persistence redaction and payload size limits in Phase 1 before records touch storage.
- [Storage]: Dedicated SQLite WAL mode with micro-batch write buffer in Phase 2 to prevent UI thread frame drops during network bursts.
- [Interception]: Implement non-destructive StreamTransformer proxies and synthetic header deduplication in Phase 3.
